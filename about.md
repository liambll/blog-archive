Thanks for visiting my blog!

My name is Liam. I graduated with double degree in Business Analytics & Computer Science, and a masters in Big Data & Machine Learning. I am fortunate to witness the power of data analytics in my work across operational improvement, marketing analytics and big data services. The main purpose of this blog is to briefly summarize various quantitative techniques.

Although the blog only focuses on technical aspect of analytics, it should be emphasized that end-to-end analytics process is important for the success of analytics projects. I recently attain Certified Analytics Professional credential awarded by the Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences (INFORMS), and I would like to recap its best practice analytics process here:

## 1. Business Problem Framing
* understand business problem, its benefits and constraints
* determine if the business problem can potentially be solved with an analytics solution

It is important to obtain a clear objective at this initial stage. For example, "sales performance" can refer to total sales, sales margin, sales per customer, etc. The key is to be specific (5W is useful here).

## 2. Analytics Problem Framing
* reformulate business problem into an analytics problem with initial set of drivers (inputs, outputs)
* specify assumptions and success metrics

This step is the "last chance to correct any mistakes or misunderstanding while it is still cheap to do so".

## 3. Data Collection
* identify data sources and acquisition 
* perform data wraggling and exploration

This is probably the most boring and time consuming step, but it is crucial to have quality data before proceeding to model building.

## 4. Model Building
* identify available quantitative methods for the analytics problem
* perform model building, evaluation and selection

Depending on the nature of the analytics problem, it might be neccesary to compromise model accuracy to gain model intepretability.

## 5. Model Deployment
* perform business validation of the selected model
* integrate model in existing process in production environment
* monitor business performance and recalibrate the model

Monitoring business performance overtime can help detect changes that might invalidate previous model assumptions, and provide a mean to measure values brought by the model.
