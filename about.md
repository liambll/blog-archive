Thanks for visiting my blog!

My name is Liam. I graduated with double degree in Business Analytics & Computer Science, and a masters in Big Data & Machine Learning. I am fortunate to witness the power of data analytics in my work across operational improvement, marketing analytics and big data services. The main purpose of this blog is to briefly summarize various [quantitative techniques](/blog/overview-techniques/).

Although the blog only focuses on technical aspect of analytics, it should be emphasized that end-to-end analytics process is important for the success of analytics projects. I recently attain Certified Analytics Professional credential awarded by the Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences (INFORMS), and I would like to recap its best practice analytics process [here](/blog/overview-process/).
