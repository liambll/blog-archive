"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains." While regression and its generalized model such as logistics regression aims to capture lienar relationship, Neural Network is well-known for learning non-linear relationship. Neural Network model can be used in both supervised learning, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. This post focuses on a simpliest form of neural network called Feedforward neural network, also known as multi-layer perceptron. Advanced neural network models such as autoencoder, convolution neural network and recurrent neural network will be discussed in separate posts.

## 1. Model:
Feedforward neural network contains an input layer, an output layer, and one or more hidden layers in between:
