"Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane."

## 1. Model
Suppose some given data points each belong to one of two classes, there would be many hyperplanes that might classify separate the data into two classes. One logical choice of hyperplane is the one that represents the largest separation between the two classes.
* Distance from a data point \\(\mathbf{x}\\) to a hyperplane (\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x} + b = 0\\):
\\[
\frac{\|\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}\_0 + b\|}{\|\|\mathbf{w}\|\|_2}
\\]
where \\(\|\|\mathbf{w}\|\|\_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^k w_i^2}\\) and \\(k\\) is number of dimension.
* Support Vectors are data points with the nearest distance to the hyperplane.
* The nearest distance is called margin.

## 2. Estimation
To find the hyperplane that represents the largest separation between the two classes, we can formulate the problem as finding a hyperplane that maximizes the margin,i.e. the nearest distance from data points ti the hyperplane. Suppose the labels for two classes are \\((y = 1)\\) for points above the hyperplane and \\((y = -1)\\) for points below the hyperlane, the distance from a data point \\((\mathbf{x}\_n, y_n)\\) to the hyperplane would be:
\\[
\frac{y_n(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}\_n + b)}{\|\|\mathbf{w}\|\|_2}
\\]
Maximizing margin:
\\[
\arg\max_{\mathbf{w}, b} \left\\{
    \min_{n} \frac{y\_n(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}\_n + b)}{\|\|\mathbf{w}\|\|\_2} 
\right\\}
= \arg\max_{\mathbf{w}, b}\left\\{
    \frac{1}{\|\|\mathbf{w}\|\|\_2} \min_{n} y\_n(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}\_n + b)
\right\\}
\\]
