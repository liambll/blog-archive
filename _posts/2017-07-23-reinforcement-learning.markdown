"Reinforcement learning is a machine learning area that seek to learn how software agents should take actions in an environment in order to maximize some notion of cumulative reward."
* Compared to Supervised Learning: If we treat a supervised learning problem as a decision making problem, agent's action is predition value, and we can immidiately see the reward, which is accuracy of the prediction. In reinforcement learning, we do not know the reward until the agent performs multiple actions. Immitation learning is something in between supervised learning and reinforcement learning, in which input data contains different actions and output is whether such action is good or bad.
* Compared to Decision Analysis in Operations Research. In Operations Research, decision analysis is usually conducted assuming actions don't change state of the environment. On the other hand, in reinforcement learning, the agent's actions change state of the environment.
