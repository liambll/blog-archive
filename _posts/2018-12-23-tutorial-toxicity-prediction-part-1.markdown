"Quantitative structure–activity relationship models (QSAR models) are regression or classification models used in the chemical and biological sciences", in which the predictors consist of physico-chemical properties or structural molecular descriptors of chemicals, and the response variable can be a biological activity of the chemicals. Such models have been widely used in virtual drug screening to find molecules with desired properties.

In part 1 of this artile, we will briefly describe common virtual drug screening techniques and provide a tutorial on predicting molecules' toxicity based on Morgan fingerprints - a structural molecuar descriptor. In part 2, we will provide a tutorial predicting molecules' toxicity based on Neural fingerprint learnt by a Graph Convolutional Network.

## 1. Overview of virtual screening
  
## 2. Toxicity Prediction dataset

## 3. Morgan fingerprints

## 4. Machine Learning model
