"Quantitative structure-activity relationship models (QSAR models) are regression or classification models used in the chemical and biological sciences", in which the predictors consist of physico-chemical properties or structural molecular descriptors of chemicals, and the response variable can be a biological activity of the chemicals. Such models have been widely used in virtual drug screening to find molecules with desired properties.

In part 1, we will briefly describe common virtual drug screening techniques and provide a tutorial on predicting molecules' toxicity based on Morgan fingerprints - a structural molecular descriptor. In part 2, we will provide a tutorial predicting molecules' toxicity based on Neural fingerprint learnt by a Graph Convolutional Network.
