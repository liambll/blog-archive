Data analytics techniques generally fall in to one of three non mutually exclusive fields: Operations Research, Statistics and Machine Learning. All three fields share a common mathematical foundation in probability theory, optimization, and linear algebra. They are widely used to extract insight from data, especially with the rise of Big Data.

## [Operations Research](/blog/overview-operations-research/)
"Operations research is a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions". Operations research focuses on optimization.

Examples:
* A manufacturing firm wants to find an optimal inventory level in order to minimize inventory storage cost but still be able to meet demand 95% of the time.
* A postal service company wants to find out the optimal route for its delivery truck to fulfill delivery requests in shortest distance.

## [Statistics](/blog//overview-statistics/)
"Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data." The main focus of Statistical Analysis is interpretation.

Examples:
* An e-commerce company has several alternative designs for its new web product. The company wants to find out which design would have more customer click rate.
* A research institution wants to find out if higher mortality rate is associated with tobacco use.

## [Machine Learning](/blog/overview-machine-learning/)
"Machine Learning is a subfield of computer science that give computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed." A key characteristics of Machine Learning is prediction.

Examples:
* An e-commerce company has historical data on customer purchases. The company wants to find products that each customer is most likely to purchase and send email marketing on those products to each customer. 
* An IT security firm wants to build an application to detect network intrusion based on network connection characteristics.

## [Big Data](/blog/overview-big-data/)
"Big data is a term for datasets that are so large or complex that it would be challenging to ingest, store, analyze, query and visualize such datasets."
