"Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data."
Characteristics of statistics techniques:
* Statistics makes assumptions about underlying data (eg. probability distribution) because we can only generalize statistical analysis on unknown data if the data follows specific characteristics. When the assumptions are severely violated, the statistical model would be deemed invalid. A statistician would frown if someone apply linear regression model on a data that follow Poisson distribution.
* Unlike machine learning techniques which focus on prediction, Statistics seeks understanding and intepretation of data.
* Statistics has strong focus on likelihood and confidence. While machine learning techniques only asnwer with the "best estimate", statistics techniques can provide interval estimation and associated likelihoods. A Machine learning engineer might say the stock price is most likely to be $40, and a Statistician would say at 95% confidence level, the stock price is within $36-$44.
