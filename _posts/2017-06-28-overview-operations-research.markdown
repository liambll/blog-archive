"Operations research is a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions."
Characteristics of operations research techniques:
* Unlike Machine Learning and Statistics which focus on inference and prediction, Opeartions Research focuses on decision making under constraints
* Operations research is often concerned with determining the maximum (of profit, performance, or yield) or minimum (of loss, risk, or cost) of some real-world objectives given certain constraints

## 1. Linear Programming

## 2. Network Models

## 3. Inventory Modeling

## 4. Queue Modeling

## 5. Simulation Modeling

## 6. Decision Analysis

## 7. Forecasting
