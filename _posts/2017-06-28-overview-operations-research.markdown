"Operations research is a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions."

* Unlike Machine Learning and Statistics which focus on inference and prediction, Opeartions Research focuses on decision making under constraints
* Operations research is often concerned with determining the maximum (of profit, performance, or yield) or minimum (of loss, risk, or cost) of some real-world objectives given certain constraints
