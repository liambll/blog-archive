"Linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables." In Statistics, Linear regression is used to understand how changes in explanatory variables would affect the dependent variable. In machine learning, the focus is more to predict value of dependent variable based on explanatory variables.

Some examples:
- analyze relationship between customer's satisfaction and customer's waiting time, call duration, discussion topic, etc
- predict house price based on the house's characteristics (location, areas, number of bed rooms, number of bath rooms, etc)
