"Linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables."  Linear regression can be used to quantify the strength of relationship between explanatory variables and the dependent variable. It can also be used to predict value of dependent variable based on explanatory variables.
From statistical perspectice, linear regression focuses on the conditional probability distribution of y given X, rather than on the joint probability distribution of y and X, which is the domain of multivariate analysis.

Some examples:
- analyze relationship between customer's satisfaction and customer's waiting time, call duration, discussion topic, etc
- predict house price based on the house's characteristics (location, areas, number of bed rooms, number of bath rooms, etc)

## 1. Model
Relationship between a dependent variable y and k explanatory variables \\(\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_k] \\):
\\[
y = f(\mathbf{x}) + \epsilon = w_0 + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + ... + w_k x_k + \epsilon 
\\]
* y is dependent variable (or output)
* \\(\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_k] \\) is a vector of explainatory variables (or inputs) 
* \\(\mathbf{w} = [w_0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_k] \\) is a vector of weights, in which \\(w_0\\) is bias term and \\(w_i\\) denotes strength of linear relationship between y and \\(x_i\\) in the model
