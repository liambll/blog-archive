Hypothesis testing is a confirmatory data analysis procedure to confirm or reject a statistical hypothesis. The general procedure for hypothesis testing involves 3 steps:
* Make an initial assumption
* Collect sample data
* Decide whether to reject or not reject the initial assumption, based on the sample data

## 1. Description
In hypothesis testing, we first define two hypothesis:
* __Null hypothesis \\(H_0\\):__ an assumption that we want to reject
* __Alternative hypothesis \\(H_a\\):__ a "rivalry" assumption that is contrary to the null hypothesis

We always assume the null hypothesis is true and then collect evidence (sample data) to draw conclusion about that assumption __at a certain level of confidence__. Please note that we can never be 100% confidence and accept a hypothesis. Therefore, we usually say __reject__ or __fail to reject__ a hypothesis. There are two types of error in hypothesis testing:

* __Type I error:__ happens when we reject the null hypothesis while in fact it is true.
* __Type II error:__ happens when we fail to reject the null hypothesis whil ein fact it is false

* Sample size
* Significant Level
* p-value
* Power of test
